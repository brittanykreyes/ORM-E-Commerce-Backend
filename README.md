# E-commerce Back End

## Description

This project provides the backend for an e-commerce website using **Express.js**, **Sequelize ORM**, and a **PostgreSQL** database. The API allows for the management of categories, products, and tags, and performs CRUD operations through a RESTful interface. The application connects to a PostgreSQL database, syncs Sequelize models, and seeds test data for easy testing.
